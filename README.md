# Story

I've created this app to get more practice with Atomic Design pattern.

I based on the following articles:
- [Part 1](https://medium.com/engineering-zemoso/atomic-design-in-react-react-native-using-a-theming-library-part-1-4fc2e0e2ccc8)
- [Part 2](https://medium.com/engineering-zemoso/atomic-design-in-react-react-native-using-a-theming-library-part-2-6aa6d3b9de13)

I've decided to user Styled Components instead of Material Design. 

I'm using Jenkins to for building this app and deploy to aruba server. 
In meantime I found [Buddy](https://buddy.works/docs/quickstart/java) as another approach to CI/CD.
